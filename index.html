        <h2> Our Mission </h2>
            <p> The FIRST Resource Center was founded to create a community of support and develop a network of resources for Tufts University's first generation, low-income, and undocumnted populations. We welcome all backgrounds and hope to ensure first-gens feel empowered and prepared for their academic, social, and professional lives.  <img src="FIRSTphoto.jpeg" /> </p>

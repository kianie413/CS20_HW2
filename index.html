        <h3> Our Mission </h3>
            <p> The FIRST Resource Center was founded to create a community of support and develop a network of resources for Tufts University's first generation, low-income, and undocumnted populations. We welcome all backgrounds and hope to ensure first-gens feel empowered and prepared for their academic, social, and professional lives.</p>

            <p> 2. Provide a safe and inclusive space for undocumented students, students with intersecting marginalized identities, and first generation students. </p>
            <p> 3. Serve as a safe space. </p>
